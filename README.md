KillerTask
=====

This is a Kotlin Android library to create async background tasks. Inspired by [TinyTask](https://github.com/inaka/TinyTask), but more beautiful and easy to use for Kotlin Android developments.

### Abstract
Android's `AsyncTasks` are highly criticized for being bad, unreliable, outdated, etc. Are they perfect? No.
Do we have better alternatives? Sure, but sometimes all we want is a quick and simple way to run something in the background.

### What is it, really?
Just a wrapper around an `AsyncTask`, with a funny looking API.
The main difference between KillerTask and TinyTask is that this library is written in Kotlin language, very different from Java.

### How to download and install it
Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
	maven {
		url "https://jitpack.io"
	}
}

dependencies {
	// ...
  compile 'com.github.inaka:killertask:v1.4'
  // ...
}
```

### Code examples

```kotlin
    val onSuccess: (String) -> Unit = {
        result: String ->
        Log.wtf("result", result)
    }

    val onFailed: (Exception?) -> Unit = {
        e: Exception? ->
      	Log.wtf("result", e.toString())
    }

    val doWork: () -> String = {
        "test" // implicit return
    }

    var killerTask = KillerTask(doWork, onSuccess, onFailed)
```
```kotlin
    killerTask.go() // to execute it 
```
```kotlin
    killerTask.cancel() // to cancel it
```

Or simply you can do:

```kotlin
    KillerTask(
            { "test" }, // task
            {result: String -> Log.wtf("result", result)}, // onSuccess actions
            {e: Exception? -> Log.wtf("result", e.toString())} // onFailed actions
        ).go()
```

Actually, the only strongly necessary parameter is the first one (the main task):

```kotlin     
    KillerTask({ Log.wtf("LOG", "KillerTask is awesome") }).go() // only main task
```
```kotlin  
    KillerTask(
            { Log.wtf("LOG", "KillerTask is awesome") }, // main task
            { Log.wtf("LOG", "Super awesome!")} // onSuccess
    ).go()
```
```kotlin 
    KillerTask(
            { // main task
                Log.wtf("LOG", "KillerTask is awesome")
                "super" // implicit return
            },
            {}, // onSuccess is empty
            { e: Exception? -> Log.wtf("LOG", e.toString()) } // onFailed
    ).go()
```
